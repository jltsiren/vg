/**
 * A representation of the haplotypes in a graph.
 *
 * The graph is partitioned into top-level chains, which are further partitioned
 * into subchains. Each subchain contains a set of kmers and a collection of
 * sequences. Each sequence is defined by a bitvector marking the kmers that are
 * present.
 *
 * At the moment, the kmers are minimizers with a single occurrence in the graph.
 * The requirement is that each kmer is specific to a single subchain and does
 * not occur anywhere else in either orientation. (If no haplotype crosses a
 * snarl, that snarl is broken into a suffix and a prefix, and those subchains
 * may share kmers.)
 *
 * NOTE: This assumes that the top-level chains are linear, not cyclical.
 *
 * Versions:
 * * Version 6: Tags for storing metadata, such as graph names. Compatible with
 *   version 5.
 *
 * * Version 5: Every path in the graph is assigned to a construction job.
 *   This allows including reference paths that do not visit any snarls in the
 *   sampled graph. Not compatible with earlier versions.
 *
 * * Version 4: Subchains can have fragmented haplotypes instead of a single
 *   GBWT sequence always crossing from start to end. Compatible with version 3.
 *
 * * Version 3: Subchains use smaller integers when possible. Compatible with
 *   version 2.
 *
 * * Version 2: Top-level chains include a contig name. Compatible with version 1.
 *
 * * Version 1: Initial version.
